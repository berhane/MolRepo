# MolRepo

MolRepo is a repository of of Cartesian coordinates and binding energies of molecular clusters that
anyone should be able to contribute to.  It was designed and built by Patrick Musau, Berhane Temelso and George Shields.

It was inspired by the likes of
- [BEGDB](http://www.begdb.com/), 
- [Cambridge Cluster Database](http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/CCD.html), 
- [The BioFragment Database (BFDb)](http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/active_bfdb/bfdb/cgi-bin/bfdb.py). 

This repo is implemented at [http://molecularclusters.xyz](http://molecularclusters.xyz). While it currently only contains data from our own publications, others are encouraged to contribute to it.

We also intend to share the framework to others so that they can implement it in their environments.
